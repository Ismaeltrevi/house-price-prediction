# Kings County Housing Bake-off

## Overview

Using data exploration, feature engineering, and statistical test, I created a model to predict prices of houses in Kings County, Seattle. This repository contains files that will lead to a final prediction that have not been trained and it did not contain prices.

### Deliverables
1. GitHub repository with all the files
2. Jupyter notebook with EDA, Feature Engineering, statistical tests, and model evaluation.
3. Holdout predictions

### Business Problem:
1. What are the most important variables in predicting the selling price of a house?
- It turns out that most of the variables helped predicting house prices. The features with the highest correlations with price were number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and square-feet living space.

2. What variables can we create to make a strong model?
- All the continuous variables helped to create a better model. However, categorical variables did not help as much. Zipcodes was an exception.

3. Does the year when the house was built influences the pricing?

### Data
The data set was provided by Flatiron School.
